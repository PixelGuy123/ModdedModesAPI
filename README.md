# ModdedModesAPI

An API for Baldi's Basics Plus, designed to simplify the process of creating custom buttons and screens for the Main Menu. While the plugin's name might suggest the creation of "new modes", its core functionality focuses on enhancing UI extensibility - that is, it can provide ways to **access** new game modes - through buttons and screens.

This plugin depends on [BepInEx (5.4.2x)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest).

You can access the releases on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/567995).

The GUID of this plugin is: `pixelguy.pixelmodding.baldiplus.moddedmodesapi`.
